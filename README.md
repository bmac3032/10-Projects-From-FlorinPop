# 10-Projects-From-FlorinPop
Based off the YouTube video by FlorinPop

🙋‍♂️ This is a collection of mini projects from the legendary FlorinPop. These were taken from his video 10 projects in 10 hours. I tried to add my own twist to each of these as a way to cement the concepts behind each project. 

🔨 All of these were created with Vanilal Javascript, and they are common things you will see around the web built and powered by JavaScript. 

❓ If you have any questions, please message me here or on my Twitter! Thanks!
